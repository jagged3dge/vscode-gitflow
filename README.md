This extension provides integration and support for [gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). It is based on [this gitflow implementation](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) and intends to be fully compatible with it.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Firstly, you always have to *Initialize repository for gitflow* for your repository, then follow the command prompts and accept the defaults or write your release/production branch name.

If you already have gitflow set up for your repository, just start execcuting gitflow commands from the Command Palette!

## üé¨ Summary

![gitflow workflow](res/flow.svg)

1. A `develop` branch is created from `master`

2. A `release` branch is created from `develop`

3. `Feature` branches are created from `develop`

4. When a `feature` is complete it is merged into the `develop` branch

5. When the `release` branch is done it is merged into `develop` and `master`

6. If an issue in `master` is detected a `hotfix` branch is created from `master`

7. Once the `hotfix` is complete it is merged to both `develop` and `master`
